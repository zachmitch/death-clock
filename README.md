# death-clock
Find out when you will die!

I was listening to music while working through some programming book
and heard the song “When" by Grachan Moncur, a song that reminds me to think
of 'when' I will die.  Then I thought, “Wow, how cool would it be to just make a death
calculator, so I’ll know “When”.

Final version would take into account several factors that include current basic inputs (age, country of residence, sex) as well as bmi, lifestyle behaviors, and risk aversion.  I'm doing research into actuarial tables for life insurance companies and translating the most relevant drivers of death in to this document.  

Final-final version will also be re-written as web app.
