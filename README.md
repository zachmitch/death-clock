# the-death-test
Find out when you will die
Version 2.0

I was listening to music while working through some programming book
and heard the song “When" by Grachan Moncur, a song that reminds me to think
of 'when' I will die.  Then I thought, “Wow, how cool would it be to just make a death
calculator, so I’ll know “When”.

Final version takes into account several factors that include current basic inputs (age, country of residence, sex) as well as bmi/waist-to-height, lifestyle behaviors, and risk aversion.  My numbers come from actuarial tables and research from the World Health Organization and US Department of Health, translating the most relevant drivers of death in to this document.
